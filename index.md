### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    In this lab, we learned how to utilize input from the terminal and use arguments to create a sentence or phrase. I enjoyed this lab because we were able to learn that the terminal can be used as a source of 
    input similar to how we have used std::cin in the past. We could have used std::cin to take in input but we were able to learn a new tool by using the arguments in the terminal as a source of input.

* Lab 10

    In this lab, we learned about streams which are sequences of bytes and that they can be accessed sequentially. During this lab, we specifically learned how to read a file stream by extracting numbers 
    from one file and converting them to strings. I found this very intriguing because now we were not just 
    reading input from the terminal, but instead we were using code to access files in our computer and read
    from them.

* Lab 11

    In this lab, we practiced with classes by implementing their member functions and initilizing their private data members. By doing this, we were able to practice with encapsulation and get a sense of what a class interface is like. This was one of my favorite labs because we were able to learn how to create our own types as well as how they would behave.
